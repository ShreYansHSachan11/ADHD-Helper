## Known Test Issues and Resolutions

### Current Failing Tests (51 failures):
Most failures are due to:
1. **Mock Configuration Issues**: Some mocks need adjustment to match actual implementation
2. **API Interface Mismatches**: Test expectations don't match current service implementations
3. **Timing Issues**: Some performance tests have timing-sensitive assertions
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Some modules have syntax or import issues

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Fix Mock Configurations**: Update mocks to match actual service interfaces
2. **Align Test Expectations**: Update test assertions to match current implementations
3. **Resolve Import Issues**: Fix syntax errors in task-manager and other modules
4. **Performance Test Tuning**: Adjust timing thresholds for more reliable tests
