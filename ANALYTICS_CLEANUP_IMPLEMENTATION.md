# Break Analytics Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
Implemented functionality to clean existing break reminder analytics data and ensure analytics are only updated after at least one break is completed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Break Analytics Tracker (`services/break-analytics-tracker.js`)

#### Added Data Cleaning Method
- **`cleanAllAnalyticsData()`**: Removes all existing analytics data from storage
- Clears break sessions, daily stats, weekly stats, and monthly stats
- Resets analytics settings while keeping tracking enabled

#### Modified Break Recording Logic
- **Enhanced `recordBreakSession()`**: Now only records completed breaks
- Added validation to ensure breaks lasted at least 1 minute
- Skips recording for cancelled or very short breaks
- Only records breaks with `endTime > startTime` and reasonable duration

### 2. Updated Break Timer Manager (`services/break-timer-manager.js`)

#### Added Analytics Integration
- Added `analyticsTracker` dependency
- Initializes analytics tracker during component initialization
- **Modified `endBreak()`**: Records analytics for completed breaks only
- **Modified `cancelBreak()`**: Does NOT record analytics (separate from endBreak)

#### Analytics Recording Details
- Records break type, planned duration, actual duration
- Includes metadata: work time before break, trigger method, browser focus state
- Only triggers when break is properly completed through `endBreak()`

### 3. Enhanced Background Script (`background.js`)

#### Added Analytics Tracker Initialization
- Initializes `BreakAnalyticsTracker` in both install and startup listeners
- Added global `breakAnalyticsTracker` variable

#### Added Message Handler
- **`CLEAN_ANALYTICS_DATA`**: New message type to clean all analytics data
- Handles analytics tracker initialization if needed
- Returns success/failure response with appropriate messages

### 4. Updated Popup Interface (`popup/popup.js`)

#### Added Analytics Cleaning Method
- **`cleanAnalyticsData()`**: Handles user-initiated data cleaning
- Shows confirmation dialog before cleaning
- Provides user feedback on success/failure
- Refreshes analytics display after cleaning

### 5. Enhanced Analytics Display Component (`popup/components/break-analytics-display.js`)

#### Added Clean Button UI
- Added üóëÔ∏è clean button to analytics header
- **`handleCleanAnalytics()`**: Handles clean button clicks
- **`showTemporaryMessage()`**: Shows success/error feedback
- **`refreshData()`**: Alias method for external refresh calls

#### Updated UI Structure
- Modified analytics header to include controls section
- Added event listener for clean button

### 6. Updated CSS Styles (`popup/components/break-analytics-display.css`)

#### Added Clean Button Styles
- **`.analytics-controls`**: Container for period selector and clean button
- **`.clean-data-btn`**: Circular button with trash icon
- Hover effects with error color theme
- Responsive scaling on interaction
