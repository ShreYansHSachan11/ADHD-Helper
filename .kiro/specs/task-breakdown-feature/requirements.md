# Task Breakdown Feature Requirements

## Introduction

The Task Breakdown feature provides AI-powered task decomposition using Google's Gemini API. Users can input complex tasks and receive intelligent breakdowns into manageable subtasks with time estimates, priorities, and actionable steps. This feature enhances productivity by making overwhelming tasks more approachable and organized.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Key Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely configure my Gemini API key so that I can use AI-powered task breakdown functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first accesses the task breakdown feature THEN the system SHALL prompt for API key configuration
2. WHEN the user enters a valid Gemini API key THEN the system SHALL store it securely in Chrome storage
3. WHEN the user enters an invalid API key THEN the system SHALL show an error message and request a valid key
4. WHEN the user wants to update their API key THEN the system SHALL provide a settings interface to change it
5. WHEN the API key is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt or obfuscate it for security
6. WHEN the user clears extension data THEN the API key SHALL be removed from storage

### Requirement 2: Task Input and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input tasks in natural language so that I can get AI-powered breakdowns without complex formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a task description THEN the system SHALL accept natural language input up to 500 characters
2. WHEN the task input is empty THEN the system SHALL show a validation error
3. WHEN the task input exceeds character limits THEN the system SHALL show a character count warning
4. WHEN the user submits a task THEN the system SHALL validate the input before sending to AI
5. WHEN the task contains inappropriate content THEN the system SHALL filter or reject it
6. WHEN the user presses Enter in the task input THEN the system SHALL trigger task breakdown

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Task Breakdown

**User Story:** As a user, I want my complex tasks broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks so that I can approach them systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a valid task THEN the system SHALL send it to Gemini API for breakdown
2. WHEN the API responds successfully THEN the system SHALL parse and display the breakdown
3. WHEN the breakdown is generated THEN it SHALL include 3-10 subtasks with clear descriptions
4. WHEN each subtask is created THEN it SHALL include estimated time duration
5. WHEN subtasks are displayed THEN they SHALL be ordered by logical sequence or priority
6. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and retry option
7. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback manual breakdown option

### Requirement 4: Task Breakdown Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my task breakdown in a clear, organized format so that I can easily understand and follow the steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task breakdown is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a structured list format
2. WHEN subtasks are shown THEN each SHALL have a checkbox for completion tracking
3. WHEN subtasks are displayed THEN they SHALL show estimated time and priority level
4. WHEN the user clicks a subtask THEN the system SHALL allow editing or adding notes
5. WHEN all subtasks are completed THEN the system SHALL mark the main task as complete
6. WHEN the breakdown is long THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling or pagination
7. WHEN the user wants to modify THEN the system SHALL allow reordering or editing subtasks

### Requirement 5: Task History and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want my task breakdowns saved locally so that I can reference them later and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task breakdown is generated THEN the system SHALL save it to local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the extension THEN the system SHALL load previous task history
3. WHEN task history is displayed THEN it SHALL show recent tasks with completion status
4. WHEN the user clicks a historical task THEN the system SHALL display its breakdown
5. WHEN storage becomes full THEN the system SHALL remove oldest tasks automatically
6. WHEN the user wants to clear history THEN the system SHALL provide a clear all option
7. WHEN tasks are stored THEN they SHALL include timestamps and completion data

### Requirement 6: Integration with Calendar

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create calendar reminders from my task breakdowns so that I can schedule my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task breakdown is complete THEN the system SHALL offer calendar integration
2. WHEN the user chooses calendar integration THEN the system SHALL create events for each subtask
3. WHEN calendar events are created THEN they SHALL include task descriptions and time estimates
4. WHEN the calendar API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide manual export options
5. WHEN events are created THEN the system SHALL confirm successful calendar integration
6. WHEN the user has no calendar configured THEN the system SHALL guide them through setup

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Offline Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the task breakdown feature to work reliably even when there are network issues or API problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show offline mode with cached data
2. WHEN the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for fixing it
3. WHEN the API rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry
4. WHEN the API returns an error THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN requests timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
6. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL offer manual task breakdown as fallback
7. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging while protecting user privacy

### Requirement 8: User Experience and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the task breakdown interface to be intuitive and accessible so that I can use it efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the feature THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and fast-loading
2. WHEN the user interacts with elements THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback
3. WHEN the AI is processing THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators with progress
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard
5. WHEN using screen readers THEN all elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels
6. WHEN the user makes mistakes THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance
7. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL follow the extension's design system consistently
